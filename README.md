## **2. Grant Technical Writing Support**

## **3. Data Analysis**
 
* **RNA sequencing**
    * Differential Gene Expression  
    * Single Nucleotide Variation Detection 
    * Fusion Analysis
* **Whole Genome sequencing**
    * De Novo Assembly 
    * Single Nucleotide Variation Detection 
    * Copy Number Variation 
    * Structural Variant Detection
* **Exome sequencing**
    * Single Nucleotide Variation Detection 
    * Copy Number Variation 
    * Structural Variant Detection
* **Microbiome Analysis (16s and metagenomics)**
* **Single Cell Sequencing**
* **T-cell receptor Sequencing** 
* **Methylation Sequencing (Bisulphite Sequencing)**
* **Chip Sequencing**
* **Microarray**
* **Other/Custom Analysis**

CBU also actively participates in training the next generation of biomedical researchers with the goal of enabling quality research and education.

### **We generally recommend people either to share their data for analysis via Hard Drive (Mac compatible) or via Dropbox**

_Along with Data submission we request people to fill out the following a submission form -_
