Authorship Policy

Per the guidelines of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)1, authorship credit is indicated when the following four conditions are met:

1.	substantial contributions to: the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis or interpretation of data for the work
2.	drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content
3.	final approval of the version to be published
4.	agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved

Therefore, members of the CRI Bioinformatics Unit who contribute substantially to study design, implementation, analysis, and/or interpretation should be offered the opportunity to earn authorship on all abstracts, presentations, and manuscripts stemming from joint collaborations with investigators seeking support. Investigators should invite their collaborators in the CRI Bioinformatics Unit to participate in drafting and revising abstracts and manuscripts.

Authorship order should be discussed prior to the initiation of the collaboration. The order tends to vary and often depends upon the specific contributions of the collaborating statistician(s). For example, it is customary for faculty statisticians who have participated in the design, analysis, conduct, and manuscript preparation of a clinical trial to be listed as second author. For studies requiring an intensive or high-end statistical analysis, it is also customary to list the faculty statistician(s) among the first three authors. Staff bioinformaticians are typically listed as middle authors.

Decisions about authorship are not related to funding arrangements between investigators and their collaborators in the CRI Bioinformatics Unit.
