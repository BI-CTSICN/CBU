<h2 id="general">General Information</h2>

<p>
This full-day workshop will provide participants with the opportunity to learn about the wide range of data available through
  <a href="http://www.ensembl.org">Ensembl</a>, and gain hands-on experience in navigating the Ensembl website to retrieve and interpret data.
  The workshop consists of a series of modules which include a presentation and a demonstration of the tools, followed by the opportunity to do exercises.
  Participants are encouraged to bring problems/questions about their research and we will try to tackle these during the workshop using Ensembl.

<h2 id="about-ensembl">About Ensembl</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.ensembl.org">Ensembl</a> provides an interface and an infrastructure for accessing genomic information, including genes, variants, comparative genomics and gene regulation data, covering over 300 vertebrate species. Its sister project, <a href="http://www.ensemblgenomes.org">Ensembl Genomes</a>, consists of five sub-portals (bacteria, fungi, protists, plants, and invertebrate metazoa) which contain data for over 2,000 eukaryotic (including wheat, barley, tomato and brassicas) and over 30,000 prokaryotic genomes.
</p>

<h2 id="ensembl-outreach">Ensembl Outreach</h2>

<p>
The workshop will be delivered by Louisse Paola Mirabueno, who completed her Bachelor's degree in Genetics and Cell Biology at Dublin City University, and graduated with an MPhil. at the University of Reading. Louisse joined the Ensembl Outreach team in January 2022. The Ensembl Outreach team and Ensembl are part of the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/">European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)</a>, who provide open-access resources and training to researchers around the globe.
</p>
